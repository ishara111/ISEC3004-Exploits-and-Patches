# The Patch:

The program can be corrected as follows:
1. When the user password is asked, make sure to provide the size of the buffer to the strncpy function with 1 deducted. 
    strncpy(input, userInputPassword, sizeof(input) - 1);
Then add a null pointer at the very end, to prevent the buffer from overreading.
    input[3] = '\0';

2. The pages vulnerability can be corrected by double checking if the buffer length is ALWAYS less than 4 (4 is the total number of pages)
    if (i < 4 * 7) {
        printf("%c", user_document[i]);
      }
Here the value is multiplied by 7 since one of the text blocks we assume to be pages has 7 characters. (upage1| has seven characters)
